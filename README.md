  <summary>About Me</summary>
  
  ### Hey, im Floyd (Jenn), <Br>
  Im a Medior webdeveloper that loves to do a bit of everything.<Br>
  CyberSecurity, DevOps, PHP, Go, JS, anything i really can get my hands on i will work on it.<Br>
  My biggest flaw and strength is that i keep creating new projects, but in time i redo my mistakes becuase of it.<Br>
  This way i learn better ways of programming, while also keeping my time efficient<Br><Br>
  
  So no matter what it is, ill create a whole server enviroment or making a random 3D animation with OpenGL(3d) or a new site.<Br>
  I am not sitting still, thats a promise.<Br>
  Ps, i dont have much projects to show because alot doesnt work anymore.<Br>
    (this will be fixed, explained under this message)<Br>
